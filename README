# Gaussian Classifiers Comparison

This project compares two machine learning classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The project evaluates their performance on different datasets, including linearly separable and inseparable data.

## Project Structure

- `base_estimator.py`: Contains the base classes for the estimators, such as classifiers and regressors.
- `classifiers.py`: Implements Perceptron, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and LDA classifiers.
- `loss_functions.py`: Defines loss functions like misclassification error and accuracy.
- `classifiers_evaluation.py`: Evaluates the performance of the classifiers using visualizations.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for plotting and data generation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.

## Features

- **Perceptron Classifier**: Finds a separating hyperplane for linearly separable data.
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**: Assumes that features are conditionally independent.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Assumes a Gaussian distribution for the features with a shared covariance matrix across classes.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib==3.3.4
- plotly

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
